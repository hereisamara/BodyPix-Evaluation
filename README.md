# BodyPix-Evaluation

BodyPix Evaluation is a repository designed to evaluate the performance of the BodyPix model on various datasets (Currently support OCHuman dataset). BodyPix is an open-source machine learning model developed by TensorFlow.js for real-time person segmentation in the browser and Node.js. This repository provides a set of scripts and tools to assess the accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics of the BodyPix model against ground truth annotations.

### Key Features
*Dataset Preparation*: Easily prepare your dataset for evaluation by following simple instructions and guidelines provided in the repository.  
*Evaluation Scripts*: Access ready-to-use Python scripts for evaluating the BodyPix model's performance on your dataset, including metrics such as IoU (Intersection over Union), Dice Coefficient, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy.  
*Batch Processing*: Utilize batch processing capabilities to efficiently evaluate large datasets, with progress tracking and results per batch.
